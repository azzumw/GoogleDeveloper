Welcome to my Google Developer Repo.

Please note: This repo is a work in progress. 

Background

This repository consists of projects(sixteen) undertaken as part of the Android Basics in Kotlin course (https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

Special attention has been given to writing instrumentation tests covering: recycler view, navigation, fragments, viewmodel and livedata, some basic customer matchers and mocking.

What the course covered:
- Kotlin language core concepts (classes and inheritance,lists, coroutines, functions, lambdas, high order functions etc.)
- Android Jetpack Compose (Navigation, ViewModel and LiveData, Pref DataStore, WorkManager)
- Data Persistence (Room, Pref Data Store)
- Networking (Kotlin coroutines)
